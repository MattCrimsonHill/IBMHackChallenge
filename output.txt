Question: Open URL in new window with Javascript

I'm making a "share button" to share the current page. I would like to take the current page URL and open it in a new window. I have the current URL part working, but can't seem to get the next part working. 
I'm struggling with the syntax. I would like to specify the new window size to width=520, height=570.
Something like: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?mini=true&amp;url=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">LinkedIn</a>

Any ideas?

Answer:

-------

Use window.open():
<a onclick="window.open(document.URL, '_blank', 'location=yes,height=570,width=520,scrollbars=yes,status=yes');">
  Share Page
</a>

This will create a link titled Share Page which opens the current url in a new window with a height of 570 and width of 520.
